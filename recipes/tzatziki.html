    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>14 oz. full-fat greek yogurt</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic - grated</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. fresh dill – finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>5 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cucumber – grated or cubed; and thoroughly drained/dried</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To Serve</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp. fresh dill – finely chopped</li>
        <li>A couple strands of the grated cucumber</li>
        <li>A splash of extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the cucumber, dry it and grate it with its peel. Keep a few strands for decorating at the end.</li>
        <li>Place it in a strainer, salt to taste, ensure the salt reaches all surfaces by stirring and then let stand for a few minutes till it starts to dry and wither.</li>
        <li>Squeeze each slice to remove all excess fluids and place into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the yogurt, garlic, vinegar, olive oil and mix with a spoon. Test if more salt is needed.</li>
        <li>Also, test the acidity of the flavor and if necessary add a little more vinegar.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the chopped herbs.</li>
        <li>Stir and freeze in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
<p>Serve cold or at room temperature. Drizzle a splash of oil and add some fresh herbs, and a bit of the grated cucumber as decor.</p>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If you are not a fan of the taste of raw garlic, you can use homemade garlic flavored oil instead of extra virgin olive oil. Use two tsp. per clove.</li>
        <li>Tzatziki can be transformed by adding vegetables such as beetroot which will transform the color, flavor, and texture of the dish.</li>
        <li>It is essential that the Tzatziki remains firm and dense, the Greek yogurt has to be the strained variety and the cucumbers have to be thin, firm and without any seeds.</li>
        <li>It is critical to squeeze and remove all the liquids from the cucumber before adding it.</li>
    </ol>
