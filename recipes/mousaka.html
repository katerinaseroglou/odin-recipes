    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This mousaka is my version of the classic and much-loved dish that has traveled the world. Because I simply adore it and because one piece is never enough, I prefer to roast the eggplant instead of deep-frying it. This makes the mousaka less oily, so I can enjoy more pieces without feeling guilty!</p>

        <h3>Ground Beef</h3>

        <li>Add the rest of the ingredients: ground nutmeg, salt, and pepper (except the eggs).</li>
        <li>Keep stirring over a medium heat for about 7-8 minutes, until the cream thickens.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one by one, beating vigorously with a whisk.</li>
        <li>Stir two tablespoons of cream into the ground beef.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>    
        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <li>Grease a baking dish or tray and sprinkle with toasted breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Put half of the eggplant in one layer and sprinkle with half the cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread half the ground beef and top with the remaining eggplant, cheese, and ground beef, in alternating layers.</li>
        <li>Finish with the cream.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 360°F and cook on the lower rack for about 50 minutes, until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let it cool (to cut into pieces) and serve.</li>
    </ol>
